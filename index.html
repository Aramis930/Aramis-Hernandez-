<p>When I'm not at school or work this is my life with my family. The two latest editions have had a large impact our family the first on is my puppy Luna. I never thought my family would okay with me owning a dog let alone open up to her the way that they have. The next editon to the family was my adorable niece Gabriella. Since she has come into this world our entire family has become more united and I've become an uncle and a godfather.

<p>Also something people often don’t know about me is that I’m originally from the Bronx, New York where I was born and raised until I transferred to West Haven to finish high school and then started attending UNH. Besides that in my free time I enjoy photography, going to the gym, playing video games and going to the movies. </p>
