	<p>Whenever I’m not at school I work at a local pizzeria (Full Circle) as a delivery driver. I’ve been working at Full Circle Pizza since the summer after I graduated high school in June 2016. My very first day of work was after my orientation at UNH. Since then I've learned all about what goes into keeping a busniness together.   </p>

	<p>This past summer I got the opportunity to complete my internship at the West Haven Police Department in the Identification & Crime Scene Unit. During my internship I got the opportunity to assist detectives in tasks such as processing crime scenes, more specifically in recognizing, documenting, collecting, preserving, and analyzing of physical evidence.</p>

<p>My experience with the West Haven Police Department was a great experience and I got to see and do a lot. Getting a hands on experience and seeing how a police department operates was really interesting. During my time there I saw bank robbery cases, 
And even got to go to two autopsies. </p>
